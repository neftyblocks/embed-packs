# ðŸ’» Development

-   Run `pnpm dev` to start the development server

# Testing

-   Run `pnpm install` install all dependencies
-   Run `pnpm play` to run the tests on the playground in development mode
-   Run `pnpm play:build` to run the tests on a build
-   Run `pnpm play:preview` to run the tests on a build and open the preview

# ðŸ“¦ Publishing

-   Commit all changes (no need to push)
-   Run `pnpm pub` to publish the package

# I like pnpm just not the command (let's rename to `P`)

1. Open the `~/.zshrc` file in your preferred text editor.

2. Next, add your alias to the end of the file, save the changes and close the editor.

```bash
alias p='pnpm'
```

3. Run the below source command, which does not provide output, but sources the `~/.zshrc` file to make the alias available in your current shell. `source ~/.zshrc`

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

4. Now you can use the alias to run the command.

```bash
p dev
```
